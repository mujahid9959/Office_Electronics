    <h1>Projection-Based Interactive Whiteboards</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Projection-Based Interactive Whiteboards use a digital projector to display content onto a whiteboard surface, which then becomes interactive. The system tracks touch input via sensors that detect the position of a finger or stylus on the whiteboard. These boards provide an excellent way to interact with projected content in classrooms, meeting rooms, and collaborative spaces, combining the benefits of a large display and interactive features.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $1,000 - $7,000</h2>
