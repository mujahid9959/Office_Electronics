    <h1>Resistive Touch Interactive Whiteboards</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Resistive Touch Interactive Whiteboards are widely used in various settings such as classrooms, conference rooms, and training facilities. These whiteboards use resistive technology, which detects touch through pressure applied to the screen, typically by a stylus, pen, or finger. The technology involves two conductive layers that sense touch when pressed together, making it a cost-effective and reliable solution for interactive digital displays.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $400 - $3,000</h2>
