    <h1>Proximity Access Control Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Proximity Access Control Systems are a popular choice for securing entry points in both commercial and residential buildings. These systems use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to grant access by detecting a proximity card or key fob. When the card or fob is within range of the reader, it automatically unlocks the door or gate, providing a secure, contactless method for entry. Proximity access control systems are widely used in a variety of settings, from offices and government buildings to apartment complexes and parking facilities.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹8,000 - ₹2,40,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
