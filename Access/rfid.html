    <h1>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Access Control Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Access Control Systems use radio waves to grant access to authorized personnel based on unique RFID tags, cards, or fobs. The system consists of an RFID reader, a controller, and RFID tags/cards. The reader detects the RFID tag when it is within range, and the controller determines whether access should be granted. This system offers a convenient, contactless way to control access to buildings, rooms, and restricted areas.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹4,000 - ₹3,00,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contactless Access:</strong> RFID systems allow for touchless entry using RFID cards or tags, reducing the need for physical contact and enhancing user convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> Users only need to present their RFID card or fob to the reader, simplifying the entry process and improving user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> RFID tags are unique to each user, providing an additional layer of security compared to traditional lock-and-key systems. Lost or stolen cards can be deactivated immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> RFID systems can be easily scaled to manage access at multiple entry points or locations, making them ideal for both small businesses and large enterprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Most RFID systems log access attempts, providing administrators with detailed records of who entered a particular area and when. This is useful for security audits and monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Other Systems:</strong> RFID access control can be integrated with other security systems such as video surveillance, alarms, and visitor management systems for a comprehensive security solution.</li>
                <li><strong>High Durability:</strong> RFID cards and tags are durable and resistant to wear, making them ideal for environments where traditional keys may be lost, damaged, or require frequent replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Management:</strong> Many RFID systems offer remote management capabilities, allowing administrators to modify user access permissions and monitor system status remotely via cloud-based interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> RFID systems can be more affordable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical or biometric access control systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
