    <h1>Card-Based Access Control Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Card-Based Access Control Systems are widely used to manage access to restricted areas using a physical card, typically an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) or magnetic strip card. These systems are commonly used in business, education, and government facilities to enhance security by granting access only to authorized individuals. The system works by swiping or scanning a card to unlock doors or gates, and the user’s access rights can be easily modified by reprogramming the card or system. Card-based systems offer high levels of convenience, security, and scalability for any organization.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹8,200 - ₹82,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RFID or Magnetic Card Access:</strong> Users can gain entry by scanning or swiping an RFID or magnetic strip card, ensuring secure and quick access to restricted areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Level Access:</strong> The system can be configured to provide different levels of access to different individuals, allowing for control over who enters which areas of a building or facility.</li>
                <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> Card-based systems maintain logs of who entered and when, providing an audit trail for security and monitoring purposes. This can be important for identifying security breaches or tracking employee movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity Access:</strong> Many card-based systems use RFID technology that allows for proximity access, meaning the user only needs to bring their card near the reader, without the need for physical contact or swiping.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Other Security Systems:</strong> Card-based access control systems can be integrated with other security systems, such as CCTV surveillance, alarm systems, and time and attendance systems, providing a comprehensive security solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Card-based systems are highly scalable, making it easy to add additional doors, readers, or users as your business or facility grows.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control Software:</strong> Many systems come with access control software, allowing administrators to easily manage user permissions, track access history, and configure system settings remotely.</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> RFID cards are durable and typically last for years without requiring replacement, making them a cost-effective solution for long-term use.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-Based Access:</strong> You can set up time-based access restrictions, ensuring that certain users can only enter specific areas during predefined hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Integration:</strong> Some modern card-based systems offer the ability to integrate with mobile apps, allowing users to access secured areas with their smartphones as a digital replacement for physical cards.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
