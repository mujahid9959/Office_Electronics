    <h1>Standalone Access Control Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Standalone Access Control Systems are security solutions that manage entry to a building or restricted area without the need for a centralized control unit. These systems work independently by utilizing components such as keypads, biometric readers, or RFID scanners to authorize access. Standalone systems are typically used for smaller applications or areas where a centralized system is not necessary.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹4,000 - ₹1,20,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Standalone systems are ideal for smaller businesses or homes where a full-scale access control system may not be required. These systems are typically more affordable compared to networked solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy Installation:</strong> These systems do not require complex wiring or a dedicated server, making them easier and faster to install than networked systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Stand-Alone Operation:</strong> They operate independently, meaning no central control panel or server is needed, making them less complicated and more self-contained.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> They can be used in various environments, such as offices, small retail businesses, residential areas, and restricted facilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Authentication Methods:</strong> Standalone systems can integrate various access methods, such as keypads, RFID cards, biometric scanners (fingerprints, facial recognition), and proximity readers.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Logs:</strong> Some standalone systems come with memory or SD card slots for storing access logs, enabling auditing of who accessed the system and when.</li>
                <li><strong>User Capacity:</strong> Depending on the model, standalone systems can manage anywhere from a few to hundreds of users, making them versatile for different applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> Some models come with battery backup features, ensuring continued operation during power outages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Standalone Access Control Systems</h2>
        <p>Standalone Access Control Systems are available in different configurations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keypad Entry Systems:</strong> These systems require users to enter a PIN code to gain access. They are cost-effective and commonly used in small businesses or homes.</li>
            <li><strong>RFID Access Control:</strong> RFID-based systems use proximity cards or fobs to grant access. This type of system is common in office buildings and secure areas that require easy, contactless access.</li>
            <li><strong>Biometric Access Control:</strong> These systems use fingerprint, face recognition, or iris scanners to verify identity and allow access. They provide a higher level of security and are often used in high-security applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity Access Control:</strong> Similar to RFID, proximity readers detect a card or fob that is in close proximity. This system offers quick, easy access without the need for physical contact.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Lock Systems:</strong> Often used in residential or small business settings, smart locks use wireless technology (like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to allow entry via mobile apps or smart devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Popular Brands</h2>
        <p>Some leading manufacturers of Standalone Access Control Systems include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honeywell</li>
