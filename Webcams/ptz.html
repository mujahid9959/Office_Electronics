        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are PTZ Webcams?</h3>
            <p>PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) webcams are advanced cameras that allow for remote control of the camera's direction and zoom, giving users the flexibility to change the view during video calls, streaming, or conferences. These webcams offer a wide range of motion, allowing you to pan (move left and right), tilt (move up and down), and zoom in or out to focus on different parts of the frame. PTZ webcams are commonly used in professional environments, including conference rooms, live streaming setups, and other high-quality video applications.</p>
