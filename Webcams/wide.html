        <h1>Wide-Angle Webcams</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Wide-Angle Webcams?</h3>
            <p>Wide-angle webcams are designed with lenses that offer a larger field of view, allowing you to capture a broader area during video calls or live streaming. These webcams are particularly useful for group video conferencing, presentations, or streaming setups where multiple people or objects need to be in the frame at once. Wide-angle webcams typically feature lens angles ranging from 90° to 120°, and they often come with advanced features like auto-focus, HD or 4K resolution, and built-in microphones for clear sound.</p>

                <li><strong>Ideal for Group Video Calls:</strong> Wide-angle webcams are perfect for group meetings or virtual classrooms, ensuring that everyone can fit into the frame without needing to adjust the camera constantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-focus:</strong> Many models come with auto-focus technology to ensure that the video remains sharp and clear, even if the camera moves slightly or the subject changes.</li>
