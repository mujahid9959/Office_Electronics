        <h1>Dual or Multi-Lens Webcams</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Dual or Multi-Lens Webcams?</h3>
            <p>Dual or multi-lens webcams feature multiple lenses and image sensors, offering enhanced capabilities for capturing more detailed and realistic visuals. These webcams allow for better depth perception, stereo imaging, and advanced effects such as 3D video capture or background removal. They are ideal for use in applications such as virtual reality, professional video conferencing, live streaming, and content creation where high-quality, multi-angle footage is needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Lenses:</strong> Dual or multi-lens setups provide greater depth, clarity, and the ability to capture detailed visuals from multiple angles simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Stereo Imaging:</strong> By using two or more lenses, these webcams can capture stereo (3D-like) visuals, ideal for immersive experiences or 3D modeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Background Removal and Depth Mapping:</strong> Some models feature software that uses the second lens to map depth, enabling advanced features like background removal or focus adjustments during video calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Field of View:</strong> Multi-lens systems offer a wider field of view compared to single-lens webcams, making them great for larger spaces or group video calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Low-Light Performance:</strong> Multi-lens webcams often use multiple sensors to improve performance in low-light settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Use:</strong> They are widely used in professional settings like live streaming, vlogging, gaming, and video conferencing, offering superior image quality and advanced features.</li>
