        <h1>Infrared (IR) Webcams</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Infrared (IR) Webcams?</h3>
            <p>Infrared (IR) webcams are specialized cameras that use infrared light to capture images or videos in low-light or complete darkness. Unlike regular webcams that rely on visible light, IR webcams can "see" using infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye. These webcams are commonly used for security, surveillance, and situations where traditional lighting is not available.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Night Vision:</strong> IR webcams can capture clear images in low-light or complete darkness by using infrared light.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and Surveillance:</strong> Widely used in surveillance systems for security purposes, allowing for constant monitoring without external lighting.</li>
                <li><strong>Invisible Lighting:</strong> The infrared LEDs used in these cameras are invisible to the human eye, making them discreet in dark environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Visibility:</strong> Provides clear images or videos in environments where traditional lighting is not ideal or available.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Many IR webcams come with motion detection sensors, making them perfect for security systems that only activate when movement is detected.</li>
                <li><strong>Used for Facial Recognition:</strong> Often used in conjunction with facial recognition systems for enhanced security in commercial or government facilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Typically ranges from 720p to 1080p HD, with some higher-end models supporting up to 4K resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>IR Range:</strong> The effective range of infrared lighting is typically between 10-50 feet, depending on the camera's design and power.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrared LED Count:</strong> Some models have built-in multiple IR LEDs to provide better low-light visibility over a larger area.</li>
                <li><strong>Lens:</strong> Often features wide-angle lenses (120° to 180°) to capture more of the surrounding area.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Many IR webcams come with built-in microphones, though some high-end models may have separate audio devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Mounting Options:</strong> Can be mounted on walls, ceilings, or placed on desks for various applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Compatible with most operating systems and commonly used with security and surveillance software.</li>
            </ul>
