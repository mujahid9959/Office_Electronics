            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Excellent Color Accuracy:</strong> IPS monitors are known for their superior color reproduction, making them ideal for tasks requiring color accuracy like photo editing, graphic design, and video production.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Viewing Angles:</strong> Unlike TN (Twisted Nematic) panels, IPS monitors maintain color consistency and brightness even when viewed from sharp angles (up to 178 degrees).</li>
                <li><strong>Better Color Reproduction:</strong> IPS monitors can produce deeper colors and a wider color gamut compared to traditional monitors, providing a richer and more vibrant image.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Brightness:</strong> IPS panels ensure that the image's brightness remains uniform across the screen, unlike some other panel types where brightness can vary in different areas of the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Response Times:</strong> Newer IPS panels can have faster response times, making them suitable for gaming, although not as fast as TN panels.</li>
            </ul>
