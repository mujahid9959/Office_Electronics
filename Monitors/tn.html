            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast Response Time:</strong> TN monitors are known for their incredibly fast response times, making them ideal for fast-paced gaming where every millisecond counts.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable Price:</strong> TN monitors are generally more affordable than IPS and OLED monitors, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>High Refresh Rates:</strong> Many TN monitors support high refresh rates (144Hz, 240Hz, or higher), offering smooth motion for gaming and other fast-moving visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Input Lag:</strong> TN panels often have low input lag, making them ideal for competitive gaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Thin and Lightweight:</strong> TN monitors tend to be thin, lightweight, and more compact, making them easy to transport or fit into smaller spaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> TN monitors are available in Full HD (1080p), 1440p, and 4K resolutions, though most entry-level models feature 1080p resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Screen Size:</strong> Available in sizes ranging from 21 inches to 32 inches, though larger sizes are less common than IPS or OLED monitors.</li>
                <li><strong>Panel Technology:</strong> TN panels utilize liquid crystals twisted in a specific orientation, which allows light to pass through. This results in faster response times, but limited color accuracy and viewing angles.</li>
                <li><strong>Refresh Rate:</strong> High refresh rates are a key feature of TN monitors, often ranging from 60Hz to 240Hz, allowing for ultra-smooth visuals in fast-action games.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> TN monitors come with various connectivity options such as HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, and occasionally USB-C. Gaming models may also include adaptive sync technologies like NVIDIA G-SYNC or AMD FreeSync.</li>
                <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> TN monitors typically offer brightness levels between 250 to 350 nits, which is sufficient for most indoor environments but may struggle in very bright rooms.</li>
