            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Energy Efficiency:</strong> LED monitors are more power-efficient than traditional LCD monitors because they use LED backlighting instead of fluorescent backlighting.</li>
                <li><strong>Thinner Design:</strong> LED monitors are slimmer and lighter compared to traditional LCD monitors, offering better portability and saving space.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Color and Contrast:</strong> With superior backlighting, LED monitors offer brighter images and enhanced color accuracy, especially when using IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Response Time:</strong> Some LED monitors, particularly those designed for gaming, feature quicker response times (as low as 1ms), reducing motion blur during fast action scenes.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> LED monitors are more eco-friendly due to their energy efficiency and fewer harmful materials compared to older monitors.</li>
            </ul>
