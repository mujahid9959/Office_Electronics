            <h3>What Are Bone Conduction Headsets?</h3>
            <p>Bone conduction headsets are a unique type of headphones that use vibrations to transmit sound through the bones of your skull, bypassing the eardrum entirely. This makes them an excellent option for individuals who need to maintain situational awareness, such as during outdoor activities like running or cycling. They allow users to listen to music or take calls while still hearing surrounding sounds.</p>
