            <h3>What Are Mono Headsets?</h3>
            <p>Mono headsets are designed to offer a single earpiece for listening, with a microphone placed on one side, typically used for hands-free communication. These headsets are ideal for professionals who need to maintain awareness of their surroundings while still being able to take calls or listen to audio. Commonly used in office environments, call centers, and for driving, mono headsets are popular for their practicality and ease of use.</p>
