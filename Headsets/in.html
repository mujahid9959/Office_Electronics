            <h3>What Are In-Ear Headsets (Earbuds)?</h3>
            <p>In-ear headsets, or earbuds, are small, lightweight headphones designed to fit directly into the ear canal. They are highly portable and provide good sound quality while being discreet and comfortable. Earbuds are often used for activities like commuting, exercising, or traveling due to their small size and wireless options. Despite their compact design, many models offer impressive sound performance and noise isolation.</p>
