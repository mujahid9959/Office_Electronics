    <h1>Double Conversion UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A Double Conversion UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is a type of UPS that provides the highest level of power protection by continuously converting incoming AC power into DC and then back to AC. This process ensures that the connected devices always receive clean, stable power, free from voltage fluctuations, surges, and noise. Unlike other UPS systems that switch to battery power during power disturbances, Double Conversion UPS systems continuously run on battery power, providing constant protection. They are ideal for high-sensitivity equipment such as servers, medical devices, and telecom infrastructure.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $500 - $10,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
