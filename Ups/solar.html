    <h1>Solar UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Solar UPS systems combine the benefits of traditional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) technology with renewable energy from solar panels. These systems provide backup power during outages while also reducing dependence on the grid. By using solar energy to charge batteries, Solar UPS units ensure a sustainable and cost-effective solution for power protection. Solar UPS systems are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications to support essential equipment such as computers, servers, telecom systems, and industrial machinery, all while minimizing environmental impact.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $500 - $20,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Renewable Energy Source:</strong> Solar UPS systems use solar panels to harness sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which is stored in batteries for later use, ensuring power during grid failures.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-friendly:</strong> By relying on solar energy, Solar UPS systems significantly reduce carbon footprints and reliance on non-renewable energy sources, making them an environmentally friendly option.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Over time, Solar UPS systems can help reduce electricity costs by utilizing solar power and providing backup during outages without needing to rely on expensive grid power or fuel-based generators.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Independence:</strong> These systems offer greater energy autonomy by reducing reliance on the public power grid, especially useful in off-grid locations or areas with frequent power interruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Investment:</strong> Solar UPS systems have a long lifespan, with solar panels often lasting 25 years or more, offering a good return on investment over time with minimal maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Switching:</strong> Solar UPS systems automatically switch from solar power to battery backup when grid power is lost, ensuring seamless operation of critical devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalable Solutions:</strong> Solar UPS systems are scalable, meaning they can be customized with more panels and batteries to meet the specific energy needs of the user, whether for small homes or large commercial applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> The batteries in Solar UPS systems store excess energy generated by the solar panels, allowing the system to provide backup power even at night or on cloudy days.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
