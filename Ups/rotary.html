    <h1>Rotary UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Rotary UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems use mechanical energy to provide power backup in the event of a power failure. Unlike traditional UPS systems that rely on static electronics to supply backup power, Rotary UPS systems utilize a rotating flywheel or generator to produce energy during an outage. These systems are primarily used in large-scale applications where high capacity, long-duration backup, and minimal downtime are essential. They are often used in industries like manufacturing, data centers, and telecommunications, where uninterrupted power is critical.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $20,000 - $500,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flywheel or Mechanical Energy Storage:</strong> Rotary UPS systems store energy in a rotating flywheel or generator. When power is lost, the mechanical energy is converted to electrical power to keep systems running smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>High Capacity:</strong> These systems are ideal for applications that require high-capacity, long-duration power backup, offering uninterrupted power during extended outages.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Rotary UPS systems typically require less maintenance compared to traditional battery-based UPS systems, making them a cost-effective solution for large-scale power protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Rotary UPS systems are highly efficient at converting mechanical energy into electrical power, which reduces energy consumption and operational costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Extended Runtime:</strong> These systems can provide backup power for extended periods, which is particularly useful in industries like manufacturing and telecommunications where uptime is critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Life Cycle:</strong> With fewer components that degrade over time, rotary UPS systems generally have a longer lifespan compared to conventional UPS systems, making them a good long-term investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Downtime:</strong> The flywheel or generator provides instantaneous backup power with virtually no delay, ensuring that there is no interruption in power during the transition.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Rotary UPS systems are more environmentally friendly than traditional battery-based UPS units as they avoid the use of hazardous chemicals and offer energy-efficient operation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
