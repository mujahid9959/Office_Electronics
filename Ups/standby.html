    <h1>Standby UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A Standby UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is a type of UPS system that provides basic battery backup protection for your electronic devices during power outages. Standby UPS units are primarily designed to protect computers, home electronics, and other sensitive devices from power surges, voltage drops, or blackouts. During normal operation, these UPS systems run directly off the main power supply. In case of a power failure, the UPS switches to its battery backup mode, providing power to connected devices until the issue is resolved or the system is safely shut down.</p>
