    <h1>DC UPS (Direct Current Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>DC UPS (Direct Current Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems are designed to provide continuous DC power to equipment and devices during a power outage or disturbance. Unlike traditional AC-based UPS systems, DC UPS is used in applications where DC voltage is required for the operation of devices such as telecommunication equipment, industrial machinery, and control systems. These systems store energy in batteries and deliver it as DC power, ensuring uninterrupted performance during power failures or fluctuations.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $500 - $20,000</h2>
