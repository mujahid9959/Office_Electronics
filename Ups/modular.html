    <h1>Modular UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Modular UPS systems are a flexible and scalable solution designed to provide reliable and efficient power protection. Unlike traditional UPS units, modular UPS systems are composed of individual, hot-swappable modules that can be added or removed based on the power needs of the system. This modularity makes them ideal for businesses and data centers that require a customizable solution with the ability to scale up or down over time. Modular UPS systems provide superior redundancy, high efficiency, and can be expanded as the load increases, making them an excellent choice for growing businesses and critical applications.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $1,500 - $50,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Modular UPS systems allow you to add or remove modules as needed to adjust the power capacity, making them highly scalable for growing businesses or changing power requirements.</li>
