    <h1>Line-Interactive UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A Line-Interactive UPS is a type of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that provides protection to electronic devices from power interruptions, surges, and voltage fluctuations. Unlike Standby UPS systems, which only provide power backup during outages, Line-Interactive UPS systems continuously regulate the voltage and provide battery backup during power failures. These UPS units are ideal for environments that experience frequent power fluctuations, such as homes, small offices, and data centers, where equipment needs consistent protection from voltage sags, spikes, or brownouts.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $100 - $500</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voltage Regulation:</strong> Line-Interactive UPS systems are equipped with Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) technology, which adjusts high and low voltages to stable levels without switching to battery power.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Power Protection:</strong> These UPS units provide continuous power protection for sensitive electronics, keeping devices running smoothly during minor power fluctuations without drawing from the battery.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> In the event of a power outage, the system switches to battery backup instantly, providing enough time to save data and shut down equipment safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Surge and Spike Protection:</strong> Line-Interactive UPS systems include surge protection to guard devices against damage caused by power surges, lightning strikes, and spikes.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Energy Usage:</strong> These systems are designed to be energy efficient, providing a balanced performance during both normal and backup operation to minimize electricity consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Outlets:</strong> Many models come with multiple outlets, allowing multiple devices to be connected and protected at the same time.</li>
                <li><strong>LCD Display and Indicators:</strong> Some Line-Interactive UPS systems include an LCD screen that displays important information such as battery status, load level, and input/output voltage, giving users real-time insights into the systemâ€™s operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact and Reliable:</strong> Line-Interactive UPS units are often more compact than online UPS systems, making them suitable for smaller spaces like home offices or retail stores.</li>
            </ul>
