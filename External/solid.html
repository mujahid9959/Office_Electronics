    <h1>Solid State Drive (SSD)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a high-performance data storage device that uses NAND flash memory to store data, unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDD) that rely on spinning magnetic disks. SSDs are faster, more reliable, and consume less power, making them ideal for use in laptops, desktops, and servers. They offer faster boot times, quicker file transfers, and overall improved system responsiveness.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $40 - $500</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster Performance:</strong> SSDs provide faster data access speeds, significantly improving boot times, file transfers, and application loading times compared to traditional HDDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Without moving parts, SSDs are less prone to physical damage from shocks or vibrations, making them more durable and reliable than HDDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Power Consumption:</strong> SSDs consume less power than HDDs, leading to longer battery life in laptops and lower electricity usage in desktops.</li>
                <li><strong>Silent Operation:</strong> Since SSDs have no moving parts, they operate quietly, unlike HDDs which produce noise during read/write processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact Design:</strong> SSDs are smaller and lighter than traditional HDDs, allowing for more compact and sleek device designs, especially in laptops and ultrabooks.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Heat Generation:</strong> SSDs generate much less heat compared to HDDs, contributing to overall system stability and longevity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
