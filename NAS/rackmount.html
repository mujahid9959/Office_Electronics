    <h1>Rackmount NAS (Network Attached Storage)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Rackmount NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a scalable, high-performance storage solution designed for businesses or enterprises that require centralized storage with robust management capabilities. Unlike desktop NAS devices, rackmount NAS systems are designed to be mounted in server racks, making them ideal for environments that require high-density storage and a large number of users. Rackmount NAS systems typically feature multiple drive bays, higher processing power, and enhanced scalability for handling heavy workloads, large datasets, and high-availability setups.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $500 - $10,000 (depending on capacity, features, and configurations)</h2>
