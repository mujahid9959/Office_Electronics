    <h1>Wired Alarm Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Wired alarm systems are traditional security systems that rely on physical wires to connect various components, such as sensors, control panels, and alarms. While these systems require professional installation, they are known for their reliability and robust performance, especially in environments where a stable connection is necessary. Wired systems are ideal for permanent installations and larger properties, offering high levels of security with minimal risk of interference or signal loss.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹16,000 - ₹1,20,000 (one-time cost)</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stable and Reliable:</strong> Wired systems offer a reliable connection with minimal risk of interference or signal loss, making them suitable for both residential and commercial properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Installation:</strong> These systems require professional installation, ensuring that all components are properly connected and configured for optimal performance.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security:</strong> Wired systems are often seen as more secure than wireless systems because they are not susceptible to hacking or interference from other wireless devices.</li>
                <li><strong>No Battery Issues:</strong> Unlike wireless systems, wired alarm systems do not rely on batteries, eliminating the need for battery replacements or concerns over low battery warnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Coverage:</strong> These systems are ideal for large buildings or commercial spaces where wireless systems might struggle to cover large areas or multiple floors.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Maintenance Costs:</strong> With no need for frequent battery changes or updates, wired systems typically require less ongoing maintenance, resulting in lower long-term costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Other Security Systems:</strong> Wired systems can be easily integrated with other security technologies, such as CCTV, fire alarms, or access control systems, to create a comprehensive security network.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Wired Alarm Systems</h2>
        <p>Wired alarm systems come in various configurations to suit different needs. Some of the common types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burglar Alarm Systems:</strong> The most common type, used to detect unauthorized entry into a building through door/window sensors and motion detectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems are designed to detect smoke, heat, or carbon monoxide and provide alerts in case of fire or environmental hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitored Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems are connected to a central monitoring station, which alerts emergency responders if the alarm is triggered.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Alarm Systems:</strong> A simple alarm system that sounds an alert when triggered but does not connect to a monitoring service. It is suitable for smaller properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Automation Systems:</strong> Some wired alarm systems can be integrated with home automation systems, allowing remote control of lights, thermostats, and locks in addition to security functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Wired alarm systems are widely used in the following scenarios:</p>
