    <h1>Unmonitored (Local) Alarm Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Unmonitored (local) alarm systems are security systems that trigger an audible alarm (such as a siren or flashing lights) when a security breach is detected, but they do not notify a third-party monitoring center. Instead, these systems rely on the loud alarm to alert those nearby, such as neighbors or passersby, to the situation. They are typically more affordable compared to monitored alarm systems, making them a popular choice for people seeking a basic, self-contained security solution.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹3,500 - ₹30,000 (one-time cost)</h2>
