    <h1>Fire Alarm Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Fire alarm systems are designed to detect and alert individuals to a fire or smoke emergency. They are a critical part of fire safety in both residential and commercial buildings. Fire alarms are equipped with smoke detectors, heat detectors, and fire alarm control panels that can trigger an audible alarm or notify emergency services. Fire alarm systems help prevent loss of life and property by providing early warnings of fire incidents.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹4,000 - ₹8,00,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smoke Detectors:</strong> Devices that sense smoke particles in the air, typically from combustion, to signal the presence of fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Detectors:</strong> Devices that monitor temperature increases in a given area, helping to detect fires based on heat rather than smoke.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Sensors:</strong> Some fire alarm systems include carbon monoxide detection to alert for dangerous gas buildup that often accompanies fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Pull Stations:</strong> Locations where individuals can manually activate the alarm in case of fire, ensuring quicker response times.</li>
                <li><strong>Alarm Sounders:</strong> High-pitched sirens or bells that emit a loud sound to alert occupants to evacuate in the event of a fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Alarms:</strong> Flashing lights or strobes used to alert hearing-impaired individuals or in noisy environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Sprinkler Systems:</strong> Many modern fire alarm systems can be integrated with sprinkler systems for automatic fire suppression.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> Systems often come with battery backups to continue functioning during power outages.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Some systems offer remote monitoring services that can alert emergency responders directly in case of fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Smartphone Integration:</strong> Some fire alarm systems can be connected to mobile apps for remote monitoring and control.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Fire Alarm Systems</h2>
        <p>There are several types of fire alarm systems available depending on the needs and size of the property:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conventional Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems use a set of sensors connected to a control panel. The panel determines the location of the fire based on the zone triggered by the sensors.</li>
            <li><strong>Addressable Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems offer a more advanced method of pinpointing the exact location of a fire. Each device has a unique address, allowing the control panel to identify the specific sensor that triggered the alarm.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireless Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems use wireless technology to communicate between detectors and the central control panel, offering easier installation and flexibility for upgrades.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These modern systems offer integration with smart home technology, allowing remote control and monitoring through apps and smart devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Evacuation Systems:</strong> These systems provide clear voice instructions along with the standard alarm siren, guiding people to safety in a calm, organized manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Criteria Fire Alarm Systems:</strong> These systems use a combination of smoke, heat, and carbon monoxide sensors to provide more accurate fire detection.</li>
        </ul>
