    <h1>Monitored Alarm Systems</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Monitored alarm systems are a popular choice for both residential and commercial properties, providing round-the-clock surveillance by a professional monitoring service. These systems include sensors (door/window sensors, motion detectors, etc.) that are connected to a central control panel. When an alarm is triggered, the system sends a signal to a monitoring center where trained professionals assess the situation and take appropriate action, such as notifying local authorities or dispatching emergency personnel.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹15,000 - ₹60,000+ for Systems, ₹800 - ₹3,200+ per month for Monitoring Services</h2>
