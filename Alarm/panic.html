    <h1>Panic or Duress Alarms</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Panic or Duress Alarms are essential safety devices used in emergency situations to silently alert authorities or security personnel about a distress situation. These alarms are typically used in environments where a person may be at risk of harm or coercion, such as in banks, retail stores, healthcare facilities, and personal security systems. The key feature of panic alarms is their ability to discreetly trigger an alert without the aggressor’s knowledge, allowing the individual to seek help without escalating the situation.</p>
