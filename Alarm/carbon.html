    <h1>Carbon Monoxide (CO) Alarms</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) alarms are designed to detect the presence of carbon monoxide gas, a colorless, odorless, and tasteless toxic gas that can be deadly in high concentrations. These alarms are crucial for ensuring the safety of individuals in homes, workplaces, and other environments where CO buildup may occur, such as near gas appliances, fireplaces, and boilers. Early detection of CO can prevent poisoning and save lives.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: ₹1,600 - ₹12,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Detection:</strong> CO alarms continuously monitor the environment for dangerous CO levels and activate an alarm when thresholds are reached.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Display:</strong> Some models come with a digital display showing the current CO levels, helping you assess the situation more effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> Many CO alarms feature battery backup in case of power failure, ensuring continuous protection even during outages.</li>
                <li><strong>Audible and Visual Alarms:</strong> CO alarms emit a loud siren and may include a flashing light when high levels of CO are detected, ensuring that the alert is heard and seen from a distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Battery Alerts:</strong> These alarms typically include a low battery warning so that users can replace the batteries before they become a hazard.</li>
                <li><strong>Test and Silence Buttons:</strong> CO alarms include buttons to test functionality and silence the alarm if it's triggered by non-hazardous levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Sensor Technologies:</strong> Some CO alarms use advanced sensing technologies, such as electrochemical or biomimetic sensors, for more accurate readings.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Features:</strong> Some modern CO alarms are smart devices that can connect to your home Wi-Fi and send notifications to your phone or integrate with other smart home systems.</li>
            </ul>
