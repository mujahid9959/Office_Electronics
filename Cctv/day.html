    <h1>Day/Night Cameras</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Day/Night cameras are specialized surveillance cameras designed to provide clear, high-quality video footage in both bright daylight and low-light or nighttime conditions. These cameras feature advanced sensors that allow them to adapt to varying light conditions, making them ideal for 24/7 surveillance. They are commonly used in environments that require constant monitoring, such as in homes, businesses, parking lots, or public areas. Day/Night cameras can capture sharp images in daylight and automatically switch to infrared (IR) mode when the light level drops, ensuring clear footage even in complete darkness.</p>
