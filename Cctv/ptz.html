    <h1>PTZ Cameras (Pan-Tilt-Zoom)</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras are a type of surveillance camera that can remotely pan (move left to right), tilt (move up and down), and zoom in and out. This makes them ideal for monitoring large areas or tracking specific events in real-time. PTZ cameras are widely used in various surveillance applications, from large commercial and industrial settings to public spaces, traffic monitoring, and high-security areas. With the ability to control the camera’s direction and zoom in on specific areas, PTZ cameras offer enhanced flexibility and coverage compared to traditional fixed cameras.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $150 - $3,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pan, Tilt, and Zoom Functionality:</strong> PTZ cameras allow remote control of the camera's movements, including horizontal panning, vertical tilting, and zooming in on distant objects or areas for detailed monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Resolution Video:</strong> PTZ cameras often feature high-definition resolution (1080p, 4K, or higher) for clear, sharp video quality, ensuring that important details are captured, even from a distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Coverage Area:</strong> Due to their ability to move horizontally and vertically, PTZ cameras can cover a much larger area than fixed cameras, reducing the need for multiple cameras in some settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Preset & Auto-Tracking:</strong> Many PTZ cameras offer preset positions that allow the camera to automatically return to specific angles or zoom levels. Additionally, some models have auto-tracking features, which allow the camera to follow moving objects or people within its field of view.</li>
                <li><strong>Night Vision:</strong> PTZ cameras equipped with infrared (IR) LEDs can capture high-quality video even in low-light conditions or total darkness, ensuring round-the-clock surveillance.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> PTZ cameras can be set to automatically adjust their focus when motion is detected, ensuring that key events are recorded and reducing unnecessary footage.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Most PTZ cameras offer remote viewing through smartphone apps or web browsers, allowing users to monitor footage from anywhere, anytime, and control the camera’s movements remotely.</li>
                <li><strong>Weatherproof & Vandal-Proof Housing:</strong> Many PTZ cameras are built for outdoor use and come with weatherproof and vandal-resistant housing, making them suitable for harsh environmental conditions and high-risk areas.</li>
                <li><strong>High Zoom Capabilities:</strong> PTZ cameras often have powerful optical zoom features, ranging from 3x to 30x or higher, allowing users to zoom in on specific objects or areas without losing image clarity.</li>
