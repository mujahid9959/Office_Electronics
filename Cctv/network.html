    <h1>Network/IP Cameras</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Network/IP cameras, also known as Internet Protocol cameras, are digital video cameras that can send and receive data over a network, typically through Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These cameras provide high-definition video and allow for remote viewing and control via a web browser, smartphone, or computer. Unlike traditional analog CCTV cameras, which require a dedicated cable and DVR system, IP cameras offer flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with modern surveillance systems. They are used widely in both residential and commercial security systems due to their superior image quality and the ability to be monitored from anywhere.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $50 - $2,500</h2>
