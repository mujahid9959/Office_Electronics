    <h1>Infrared (IR) / Night Vision Cameras</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Infrared (IR) / Night Vision cameras are surveillance cameras equipped with infrared LEDs that allow them to capture clear images and videos in low-light or total darkness. These cameras use infrared light to illuminate the area, providing the ability to monitor environments that would otherwise be invisible to the human eye at night or in dimly lit settings. Night vision technology is widely used in both residential and commercial security systems, offering 24/7 monitoring capability, regardless of the lighting conditions.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $50 - $2,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrared LED Illumination:</strong> The key feature of IR night vision cameras is the use of infrared LEDs, which emit infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but allows the camera to capture clear images in complete darkness.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Low-Light Video:</strong> With IR illumination, these cameras can produce high-quality video even in very low light conditions, making them suitable for night-time surveillance or poorly lit environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Range of Night Vision:</strong> Depending on the model, IR cameras can have night vision ranges from a few meters to over 100 meters, allowing for flexible monitoring depending on the area of coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Black-and-White or Color Imaging:</strong> While most night vision cameras produce black-and-white images in low light, some higher-end models can offer color night vision, providing more detailed and identifiable footage.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Many IR cameras include motion detection technology, triggering recording and alerts when movement is detected, which helps save storage space and provide more efficient surveillance.</li>
                <li><strong>Weatherproof Design:</strong> For outdoor use, many IR cameras come with weather-resistant housing, ensuring they can withstand rain, dust, and extreme temperatures, making them suitable for year-round surveillance.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Viewing:</strong> Most infrared cameras offer remote viewing options through smartphone apps, PCs, or web browsers, allowing users to monitor their property or premises in real-time, even from a distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Coverage Area:</strong> The use of wide-angle lenses in some IR cameras helps capture large areas, making them ideal for surveillance of open spaces, parking lots, or outdoor areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy Installation:</strong> Most IR night vision cameras are designed for easy installation, with options for wall-mounting, ceiling-mounting, or even standalone setups for portable use.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
