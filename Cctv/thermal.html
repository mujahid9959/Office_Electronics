    <h1>Thermal Cameras</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Thermal cameras are specialized imaging devices that capture infrared radiation (heat) emitted by objects, which allows them to create thermal images (thermograms). Unlike regular cameras that capture visible light, thermal cameras detect temperature differences and generate images based on heat signatures. These cameras are invaluable for a variety of applications where visible light is insufficient or unavailable, such as in low-light environments, fire detection, industrial monitoring, and security surveillance. Thermal cameras can detect heat sources, making them ideal for situations requiring temperature-sensitive imaging, such as in search-and-rescue operations, electrical inspections, and building diagnostics.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $200 - $15,000</h2>
