    <h1>License Plate Recognition (LPR) Cameras</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>License Plate Recognition (LPR) cameras are specialized surveillance cameras designed to capture, read, and interpret vehicle license plates. They use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to identify and store license plate information. LPR cameras are commonly used in security, law enforcement, parking management, toll collection, and access control systems. These cameras are built to handle high-speed traffic, and they can operate effectively in varying lighting conditions, including nighttime, with infrared (IR) technology.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $500 - $5,000</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic License Plate Recognition:</strong> LPR cameras are equipped with OCR software to automatically read and recognize license plates from vehicles passing through their field of view.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Speed Capture:</strong> Designed to capture vehicles moving at high speeds, LPR cameras can accurately record license plates even in fast-moving traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Day and Night Operation:</strong> Many LPR cameras feature infrared (IR) LEDs or other low-light capabilities, allowing them to work in low-light or nighttime conditions without additional lighting.</li>
                <li><strong>Weatherproof and Durable:</strong> LPR cameras are often built to withstand harsh outdoor environments, including rain, snow, dust, and extreme temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Resolution Imaging:</strong> LPR cameras offer high-resolution video to ensure clear, legible images of license plates, essential for accurate identification.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Security Systems:</strong> LPR cameras can be integrated with other security and surveillance systems, including alarms, access control, and parking management systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Analytics:</strong> Some LPR cameras come with built-in analytics, such as vehicle make/model recognition and historical tracking of vehicle movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Angle and Zoom Options:</strong> LPR cameras often come with adjustable lenses or wide-angle views to accommodate different installation needs, such as entrances, exits, or roadways.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Notifications:</strong> Some systems allow for real-time notifications when a specific license plate is recognized, alerting security personnel instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage and Data Management:</strong> Many LPR systems allow for cloud-based storage, enabling easier management and retrieval of license plate data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
