        <h1>Short-Throw and Ultra Short-Throw Projectors</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Short-Throw and Ultra Short-Throw Projectors?</h3>
            <p>Short-throw and ultra short-throw projectors are designed to project large images from a very short distance from the screen or wall. These projectors are ideal for small spaces, such as classrooms, offices, or home theaters, where there isn't much room for a traditional long-throw projector.</p>
            <p><strong>Short-Throw Projectors:</strong> Can project large images from a short distance (typically 3-8 feet). They are ideal for medium-sized rooms.</p>
            <p><strong>Ultra Short-Throw Projectors:</strong> Can project large images from very close distances (often just a few inches from the screen). These projectors are perfect for ultra-compact spaces like small conference rooms or home entertainment areas.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Space-Saving Design:</strong> Short-throw and ultra short-throw projectors allow you to project large images without needing to place the projector far away from the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Shadows:</strong> Since the projector is placed close to the screen, there's less chance of shadows being cast by people or objects in the room.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Image from a Short Distance:</strong> These projectors are designed to offer big-screen projections even in small rooms.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Placement:</strong> These projectors can be placed on a shelf, mounted on the wall, or even in front of the screen, providing flexibility for small spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideal for Interactive Presentations:</strong> Ultra short-throw projectors are often used in interactive whiteboards, classrooms, or collaborative workspaces due to their ability to project in close proximity.</li>
            </ul>
