        <h1>DLP (Digital Light Processing) Projectors</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are DLP Projectors?</h3>
            <p>DLP (Digital Light Processing) projectors use a digital micromirror device (DMD) chip to project images. The micromirrors tilt to reflect light, either toward or away from the screen, creating the image. DLP projectors are known for their high contrast ratios, brightness, and sharpness, making them a popular choice for home theaters, business environments, and educational purposes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Brightness:</strong> DLP projectors are known for their ability to produce bright, clear images even in large rooms or areas with ambient light.</li>
                <li><strong>Sharp Image Quality:</strong> These projectors deliver crisp and sharp images, making them ideal for presentations, movies, and gaming.</li>
                <li><strong>High Contrast Ratios:</strong> DLP projectors typically offer better contrast ratios, delivering deeper blacks and brighter whites.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact and Lightweight:</strong> DLP projectors tend to be more compact and lightweight compared to other types, making them portable and easy to set up.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Lasting Lamps:</strong> DLP projectors generally offer longer lamp life, reducing the cost of maintenance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> DLP projectors are available in a variety of resolutions, from SVGA (800x600) to 4K UHD (3840x2160), providing options for different use cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> These projectors offer a range of brightness levels, typically from 2,000 to 6,000 lumens, making them suitable for a variety of environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast Ratio:</strong> DLP projectors often feature high contrast ratios (typically 10,000:1 or higher), making them ideal for darker environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Common inputs include HDMI, VGA, USB, and sometimes wireless connections for streaming and presentations.</li>
                <li><strong>Lamp Life:</strong> DLP projectors offer long-lasting lamp life, ranging from 4,000 to 20,000 hours depending on the model and usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Keystone Correction:</strong> Many models come with automatic or manual keystone correction to adjust for image distortion when the projector is not aligned perfectly with the screen.</li>
            </ul>
