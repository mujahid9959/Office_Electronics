        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are LCD Projectors?</h3>
            <p>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) projectors are one of the most popular types of digital projectors. They use liquid crystal panels to project images onto a screen. LCD projectors offer bright, vibrant colors and sharp image clarity, making them a top choice for home theaters, business presentations, and educational use. They are known for their reliability and excellent color accuracy.</p>
