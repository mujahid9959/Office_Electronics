        <h1>LED Projectors</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are LED Projectors?</h3>
            <p>LED (Light Emitting Diode) projectors use LED lamps as their light source, providing a longer lifespan and lower power consumption compared to traditional lamp-based projectors. LED projectors offer vibrant colors, high brightness, and compact size, making them ideal for both home theaters and portable use. They are known for being energy-efficient, producing less heat and offering longer-lasting performance.</p>
