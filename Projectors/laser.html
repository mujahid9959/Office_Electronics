        <h1>Laser Projectors</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Laser Projectors?</h3>
            <p>Laser projectors use laser light sources to project images onto a screen. They offer superior color accuracy, brightness, and longevity compared to traditional lamp-based projectors. Laser projectors are ideal for high-performance settings such as large venues, home theaters, and professional presentations due to their vibrant colors, high contrast ratios, and low maintenance costs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Superior Brightness:</strong> Laser projectors can produce brighter images than traditional lamp projectors, making them suitable for larger rooms and environments with ambient light.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> Laser light sources can last up to 20,000 to 30,000 hours, significantly reducing the need for maintenance or lamp replacements.</li>
                <li><strong>Excellent Color Accuracy:</strong> Laser projectors are capable of producing a wider color gamut, making them ideal for projects requiring vibrant and accurate colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant On/Off:</strong> Laser projectors do not require warm-up or cool-down time, providing immediate start and stop functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Total Cost of Ownership:</strong> While the initial cost may be higher, the long lifespan and energy efficiency of laser projectors contribute to a lower total cost of ownership over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
