    <h1>Key Features of Barebones PCs</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Form Factor and Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compact and Customizable:</strong> Barebones PCs typically feature a small or medium-sized case, designed to allow users to install their own choice of processor, memory, and storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> They come in compact sizes suitable for office desks, home theaters, and small spaces where a traditional desktop would be too large.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> The key feature of barebones PCs is their modularity, allowing users to upgrade or swap out components such as the CPU, RAM, or GPU as needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Components and Specifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> Barebones PCs do not come with a CPU, so users need to choose and install their own. These PCs support a range of processors from Intel and AMD, including Intel Core i3/i5/i7 and AMD Ryzen series.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics (GPU):</strong> Barebones PCs generally come with integrated graphics or no GPU at all. Users are free to install a discrete GPU, depending on the intended use (gaming, media editing, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> RAM is not pre-installed in barebones PCs, allowing users to select the memory size and type (typically DDR4), with support ranging from 4GB to 64GB.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Barebones PCs often feature an empty storage bay where users can install their own SSD or HDD. The storage capacity typically ranges from 120GB to 2TB, depending on user preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Barebones PCs come with essential connectivity options, including USB ports, Ethernet, HDMI, and DisplayPort. Higher-end models may also offer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advantages of Barebones PCs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Users have full control over the components, allowing them to tailor the system to their specific needs, whether for gaming, productivity, or media consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Because the base system does not include a CPU, RAM, or storage, barebones PCs are often more affordable compared to fully assembled desktops, especially if users already own compatible parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade Flexibility:</strong> Barebones PCs allow for easy upgrades as technology advances, enabling users to change individual components (such as the GPU or RAM) without needing to replace the entire system.</li>
            <li><strong>Space-Saving:</strong> Most barebones PCs are compact and ideal for users who want a small desktop system without compromising on performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Limitations of Barebones PCs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requires Additional Components:</strong> Users must purchase the processor, RAM, storage, and possibly a GPU separately, which can add to the overall cost of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly Required:</strong> Assembling a barebones PC requires technical knowledge and may be challenging for beginners.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Warranty:</strong> Because users are required to assemble the system themselves, the warranty coverage on individual components may differ from a pre-built desktop PC.</li>
            <li><strong>Space for Expansion:</strong> Some barebones PCs have limited space for upgrades or may only support specific form factors for components (e.g., mini-ITX motherboards, low-profile GPUs).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
