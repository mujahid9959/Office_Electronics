    <h1>Key Features of Home Theater PC (HTPC)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Form Factor and Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compact Design:</strong> HTPCs are typically small, sleek, and designed to blend into a home theater setup. They often come in slim cases or even small form-factor designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> HTPCs often have a minimalistic and elegant design, resembling other home entertainment devices such as audio receivers and Blu-ray players.</li>
            <li><strong>Quiet Operation:</strong> HTPCs are engineered for quiet operation, often featuring passive or low-noise cooling systems to avoid disturbing movie or music enjoyment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Components and Specifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> HTPCs use power-efficient processors, often low-power Intel Core i3/i5 or AMD Ryzen processors to handle media playback without excessive heat generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics (GPU):</strong> Integrated graphics (e.g., Intel UHD or AMD Vega) are common for basic setups. However, for 4K media or gaming, a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA GTX or AMD Radeon may be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> 4GB to 8GB of RAM is typical for HTPCs, ensuring smooth streaming and multitasking without unnecessary power usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> SSDs (128GB to 1TB) are often used for fast boot times and smooth media playback, with additional storage options (e.g., 2TB HDD) for storing large media libraries.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> HDMI outputs, USB ports, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Bluetooth are standard features to ensure compatibility with TVs, sound systems, and remote controls.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advantages of HTPCs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All-in-One Entertainment:</strong> HTPCs provide access to streaming services, digital movies, music, gaming, and even live TV, making them versatile media hubs.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> HTPCs can be customized for specific tasks, such as gaming, media streaming, or digital recording, depending on the userâ€™s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with Home Theater:</strong> They can be integrated with other home theater components like receivers, speakers, and smart TVs, offering a seamless experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Space-Saving:</strong> HTPCs are designed to fit into existing home theater setups, often placed under the TV or inside a media cabinet without occupying much space.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Limitations of HTPCs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Price:</strong> HTPCs can be more expensive than other media streaming devices, especially when building custom systems with higher-end components.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Setting up an HTPC may require more technical knowledge compared to using simple streaming devices or set-top boxes like Roku or Apple TV.</li>
            <li><strong>Noise:</strong> While most HTPCs are designed to be quiet, high-performance models with dedicated GPUs or powerful processors may generate noise under heavy load.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Upgradability:</strong> Due to their compact size, HTPCs may have limited space for expansion or future upgrades, especially when using small form-factor cases.</li>
        </ul>
