            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dual Frequency Bands:</strong> Operates on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands to offer flexibility and improved speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Interference:</strong> By using two bands, dual-band routers minimize interference from other devices, improving connection quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> The 5GHz band provides faster speeds and is less crowded, making it ideal for high-bandwidth activities like streaming and gaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Range and Performance:</strong> The 2.4GHz band offers better range and is ideal for general browsing, while the 5GHz band provides higher speeds but with a shorter range.</li>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Device Support:</strong> Dual-band routers support more devices simultaneously, making them ideal for households or small offices with multiple devices connected to the network.</li>
            </ul>
