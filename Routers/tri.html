            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tri Frequency Bands:</strong> Operates on three frequency bands â€“ one 2.4GHz band and two 5GHz bands, offering enhanced network management and faster speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Congestion:</strong> Distributes traffic across three bands, reducing congestion and providing better performance for multiple devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> With two 5GHz bands, users can achieve higher speeds, even when many devices are connected at once.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideal for High-Demand Activities:</strong> Perfect for 4K streaming, online gaming, and large file transfers without compromising performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Range:</strong> Tri-band routers provide optimal coverage by balancing the traffic between the three bands, improving overall range and speed.</li>
