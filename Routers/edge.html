            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Boundary Protection:</strong> Edge routers are placed at the network boundary to protect internal network resources from external threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Routing:</strong> They efficiently route data between internal and external networks, including the internet, ISPs, and remote locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Functions:</strong> Edge routers often include built-in firewalls, VPN support, and filtering to ensure secure connections.</li>
                <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> They are designed for high uptime, supporting redundant links to prevent downtime in case of network failures.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong> Many edge routers support QoS to prioritize traffic for critical applications such as VoIP or video conferencing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Edge routers typically come with multiple gigabit and/or high-speed Ethernet ports to handle large amounts of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Firewall and Security:</strong> Built-in security features such as NAT, stateful packet inspection, and VPN support for secure connectivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Routing Protocols:</strong> Supports BGP, OSPF, and static routing to manage traffic routing efficiently between the internal network and external networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Features like dual power supplies, failover mechanisms, and load balancing for uninterrupted service.</li>
                <li><strong>Management and Monitoring:</strong> Edge routers offer web-based and CLI (Command Line Interface) management for easy configuration and real-time monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Filtering:</strong> Advanced traffic filtering capabilities to block unwanted traffic and mitigate DDoS attacks.</li>
