            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Speed Internet:</strong> Satellite modems enable broadband internet access even in remote locations with limited terrestrial infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Coverage:</strong> They can provide internet access in areas that are underserved or not served by traditional broadband networks, like rural and remote areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliable Connectivity:</strong> Satellite modems offer reliable service with minimal downtime, especially with newer high-performance satellites.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Way Communication:</strong> Many modern satellite modems support two-way communication (send and receive), allowing for bidirectional data flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for Voice and Data:</strong> In addition to internet browsing, many satellite modems can also support VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls and other forms of communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy Setup:</strong> Many satellite modems come with user-friendly setups, requiring only the connection of the satellite dish and modem to get started.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Typically requires a satellite dish, LNB (low-noise block downconverter), and modem for signal conversion.</li>
                <li><strong>Modem Speed:</strong> Modern satellite modems can support speeds from 10 Mbps up to 100 Mbps or higher, depending on the service provider and satellite technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Satellite Standards:</strong> Support for Ka-band, Ku-band, and C-band for different frequencies, with Ka-band generally offering higher speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Compatibility:</strong> Satellite modems often support Ethernet or Wi-Fi for connecting to computers, routers, and other devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Most satellite modems require an AC power source, but some may support battery backup for continuity in case of power outages.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Plans:</strong> Monthly data usage is usually subject to data limits, which vary based on the satellite service provider.</li>
