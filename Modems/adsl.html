        <h1>ADSL Modem (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric Speeds:</strong> ADSL technology provides asymmetric speeds, meaning download speeds are faster than upload speeds, which is ideal for home users who primarily download content.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliable Connection:</strong> ADSL is a reliable broadband technology commonly used in areas where fiber-optic or cable connections are not available.</li>
                <li><strong>Uses Existing Telephone Lines:</strong> ADSL operates over the same copper telephone lines already installed in homes and businesses, making it an easy and cost-effective solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> It offers low latency for web browsing, email, and other basic online activities, though it may not be ideal for high-bandwidth applications like streaming or gaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> ADSL modems are generally less expensive than other types of broadband modems (like VDSL or fiber) due to the widespread availability of ADSL infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modem Type:</strong> ADSL modems use asymmetric technology, meaning the modem provides faster download speeds compared to upload speeds, which is useful for everyday browsing and streaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> ADSL typically offers speeds from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps for downloading and 256 kbps to 1 Mbps for uploading, depending on distance from the exchange or central office.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> ADSL modems are compatible with telephone lines, and work for DSL-based internet services offered by ISPs.</li>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Most ADSL modems have at least one Ethernet port for wired connections to your computer or router, with some offering Wi-Fi capability for wireless devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Stability:</strong> ADSL provides stable connections, although speeds can be affected by distance from the exchange, with a drop in speed as the distance increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for Multiple Devices:</strong> Many ADSL modems support multiple devices, especially when they include Wi-Fi capabilities, allowing households to connect several devices simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of ADSL Modems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-Port ADSL Modems:</strong> These modems offer a single Ethernet port for wired connections, ideal for users who only need one device to connect to the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>ADSL Modem Routers:</strong> ADSL modem routers combine the modem and router functionality in one device, offering both internet access and Wi-Fi for multiple devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi ADSL Modems:</strong> These modems have built-in Wi-Fi, providing wireless connectivity for smartphones, tablets, and other Wi-Fi-enabled devices in your home or office.</li>
                <li><strong>ADSL2+ Modems:</strong> ADSL2+ is an advanced version of ADSL technology, offering faster speeds and better efficiency than standard ADSL, typically used in areas that support higher speeds.</li>
            </ul>
