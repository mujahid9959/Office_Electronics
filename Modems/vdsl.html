            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Speed Internet:</strong> VDSL provides faster internet speeds than standard ADSL, with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps, depending on the distance from the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).</li>
                <li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> VDSL uses advanced modulation techniques, enabling it to deliver higher speeds over short distances and offering better performance in urban areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> VDSL modems are compatible with older DSL technologies like ADSL, making it easy to upgrade to a faster internet connection without needing to replace the entire infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Upstream and Downstream Support:</strong> VDSL allows for symmetrical or asymmetrical speeds, supporting high-speed uploads and downloads for home or office use.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Reliability:</strong> VDSL offers a more reliable connection compared to ADSL, especially in terms of speed and stability, particularly in areas with heavy internet traffic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modem Type:</strong> VDSL modems are designed specifically for DSL internet connections that utilize VDSL technology to achieve faster speeds than ADSL.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Depending on the distance from the DSLAM, VDSL modems can support speeds of 30 Mbps to 100 Mbps for downloads and up to 10 Mbps for uploads.</li>
                <li><strong>Distance Limit:</strong> VDSL works best over short distances (usually up to 1-3 kilometers from the DSLAM), with performance decreasing as the distance from the providerâ€™s central office increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> These modems can support both VDSL and ADSL connections, making it easier to switch between the two as per the available service.</li>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Most VDSL modems come with Ethernet ports for wired connections and sometimes Wi-Fi capability for wireless devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> VDSL modems are typically compatible with ISPs offering DSL-based internet connections that support VDSL or ADSL technology.</li>
            </ul>
