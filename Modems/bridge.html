        <h1>Bridge Modem</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bridging Mode:</strong> A bridge modem operates in bridge mode, which means it acts as a simple bridge between two networks without performing any routing or network address translation (NAT).</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent Data Transfer:</strong> It allows data to pass through seamlessly between a user’s network and their Internet Service Provider (ISP), maintaining the original IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct ISP Connection:</strong> Bridge modems are used when you want to connect a router or firewall directly to the ISP’s network for more advanced features and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Bridge modems are commonly used in fiber-optic and cable internet setups, especially in situations where a user requires specific features like VLAN tagging.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Setup:</strong> Typically, bridge modems are used by advanced users or businesses that need more flexibility, such as managing their network's IP addressing or routing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modem Type:</strong> Bridge modems are typically used in fiber, DSL, or cable modem setups, where a simple pass-through of data is required.</li>
                <li><strong>Bridge Mode Functionality:</strong> In bridge mode, the modem disables its own router functionality and just transmits data without interfering with the IP packets.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethernet Ports:</strong> Most bridge modems have Ethernet ports that allow direct connections to other networking devices, such as routers or firewalls, for further management and routing.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Bridge modems typically offer the same speed as standard modems, supporting speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, depending on the service provider.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> They handle data traffic efficiently, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted data transmission between the ISP and the user’s local network.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Compatibility:</strong> Bridge modems are designed to work with third-party routers and firewalls to offer better control over your network traffic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Bridge Modems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cable Modem Bridge:</strong> A cable modem operating in bridge mode allows the direct connection of a router or firewall to the ISP, offering more control over the network.</li>
                <li><strong>DSL Modem Bridge:</strong> Similar to cable modems, DSL modems can be set to bridge mode for more advanced network configurations, such as using a third-party router or firewall.</li>
                <li><strong>Fiber Bridge Modem:</strong> Fiber modems often support bridge mode for connecting fiber-optic internet services to routers that manage larger and more complex networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Combo Modem/Router in Bridge Mode:</strong> Some modem-router combos can be switched to bridge mode to turn off routing features and use an external router for better performance and security.</li>
            </ul>
