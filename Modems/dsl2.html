            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> ADSL2+ (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 2+) provides faster download and upload speeds compared to traditional ADSL, with download speeds of up to 24 Mbps and upload speeds up to 1.4 Mbps.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> ADSL2+ technology extends the reach of broadband internet over copper telephone lines, offering higher bandwidth and better performance over longer distances.</li>
                <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> ADSL2+ modems are fully compatible with ADSL technology, ensuring they work in areas where ADSL is still in use.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Use of Bandwidth:</strong> ADSL2+ provides more efficient use of the available bandwidth, allowing for higher quality video, faster web browsing, and improved file downloads.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Availability:</strong> ADSL2+ modems are widely available in regions with established telephone line infrastructure and are supported by most ISPs that offer DSL broadband.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modem Type:</strong> ADSL2+ modems are designed specifically for DSL internet connections using ADSL2+ technology to provide faster speeds compared to regular ADSL modems.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> ADSL2+ supports download speeds up to 24 Mbps and upload speeds up to 1.4 Mbps, depending on the distance from the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).</li>
                <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> ADSL2+ modems are compatible with older ADSL standards, making it easy to upgrade to faster speeds without replacing the infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Distance Limit:</strong> ADSL2+ modems perform best within a distance of 3-5 kilometers from the DSLAM. The performance decreases as the distance from the central office increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Types:</strong> These modems generally come with Ethernet ports for wired connections and may include Wi-Fi functionality for wireless devices.</li>
            </ul>
