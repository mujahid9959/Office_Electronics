        <h1>Unmanaged Switches</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plug and Play:</strong> Unmanaged switches are easy to set up and require no configuration. Simply plug in the devices, and they will start communicating with each other automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> These switches are typically more affordable than managed switches, making them ideal for small businesses or home networks with basic requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Programmable:</strong> Unmanaged switches do not allow users to modify settings, which can be a limitation for more complex networks requiring features like VLANs or QoS (Quality of Service).</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> They offer stable, reliable network connectivity for simple applications such as web browsing, file sharing, and video streaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Design:</strong> Unmanaged switches are designed to perform basic functions such as forwarding packets between devices and do not have advanced features like traffic monitoring or security features.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Unmanaged switches come in various port configurations, including 5, 8, 12, or 24 ports, depending on the needs of the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> They generally support speeds of 10/100/1000 Mbps (Gigabit) for data transfer, with some models supporting 10Gbps speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto MDI/MDIX:</strong> Most unmanaged switches support auto MDI/MDIX, meaning they can automatically adjust to the type of Ethernet cable (straight-through or crossover) used, eliminating the need for specific cable types.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2 Switching:</strong> Unmanaged switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, which means they handle basic MAC address-based forwarding.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> Most unmanaged switches are small, compact desktop units, but larger rack-mounted versions are also available for enterprise use.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Price Range</h3>
            <p class="price">Price Range: $15 - $200 (Depending on port count, speed, and brand)</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Types of Unmanaged Switches</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Desktop Unmanaged Switches:</strong> These are compact switches that are ideal for small office or home networks. Typically range from 5 to 16 ports.</li>
                <li><strong>Rack-Mounted Unmanaged Switches:</strong> These switches are larger and designed to be installed in server racks. They are suitable for small to medium-sized businesses with more complex network needs.</li>
                <li><strong>PoE (Power over Ethernet) Unmanaged Switches:</strong> These switches can provide power to devices such as IP cameras, phones, and wireless access points over the same Ethernet cable used for data transfer.</li>
                <li><strong>Gigabit Unmanaged Switches:</strong> Gigabit switches provide faster speeds (up to 1 Gbps per port) compared to standard 100Mbps models, ideal for high-speed data transfer.</li>
            </ul>
