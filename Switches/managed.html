        <h1>Managed Switches</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Control:</strong> Managed switches allow full control over network traffic, including the ability to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot the network.</li>
                <li><strong>VLAN Support:</strong> You can create Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to segment network traffic and improve security and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong> Managed switches allow you to prioritize network traffic, ensuring critical applications like VoIP or video conferencing get the necessary bandwidth.</li>
                <li><strong>Redundancy and Failover:</strong> Support for features like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops and ensure network redundancy in case of failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Management:</strong> Many managed switches allow remote access via a web interface, SNMP, or CLI for configuration and monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Port Security:</strong> Managed switches offer more advanced security options, such as port-based authentication and monitoring for unauthorized devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Managed switches come in various port configurations, including 8, 16, 24, or 48 ports, with options for Gigabit or 10 Gigabit speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>PoE (Power over Ethernet):</strong> Many managed switches offer PoE functionality, providing power to devices like IP cameras, wireless access points, and phones over the same Ethernet cable.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2 and Layer 3 Support:</strong> Managed switches can operate at both Layer 2 (Data Link) and Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model, enabling routing capabilities in some models.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Monitoring:</strong> Features like traffic monitoring, network performance analytics, and error detection help in proactive management.</li>
                <li><strong>Redundant Power Supply:</strong> Some high-end managed switches include an option for a redundant power supply to ensure high availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Security:</strong> Managed switches often come with features like 802.1X authentication, port security, and access control lists (ACLs) for better network security.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Managed Switches</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layer 2 Managed Switches:</strong> These switches provide advanced traffic management and VLAN support but do not have routing capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 3 Managed Switches:</strong> These switches combine the features of a Layer 2 switch with basic routing functions, suitable for more complex network designs.</li>
                <li><strong>PoE Managed Switches:</strong> These switches can power devices like IP cameras, phones, and access points directly through Ethernet cables, saving space and reducing cable clutter.</li>
                <li><strong>Stackable Managed Switches:</strong> These switches can be stacked together to create a larger switch fabric for easier management and scalability.</li>
            </ul>
