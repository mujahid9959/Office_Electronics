            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Redundancy:</strong> Ensures network uptime by automatically bypassing faulty devices or connections in the event of a failure.</li>
                <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Provides continuous network availability by maintaining network traffic flow even during device downtime or maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Failover Protection:</strong> Provides automatic failover to a backup network path, preventing disruption in service.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Helps protect sensitive data by ensuring that network traffic is redirected properly when security appliances, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS), go down.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> Designed for minimal impact on network performance, bypass switches offer low-latency operation for high-speed network traffic.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Components and Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic Failover:</strong> Built-in redundancy with automatic switching between active and passive network paths during a failure.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Speed Throughput:</strong> Supports high-speed data transfer and minimal network downtime during failover events.</li>
                <li><strong>Port Configuration:</strong> Includes multiple ports to allow seamless integration with various devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and load balancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Management Interfaces:</strong> Managed through web interfaces or SNMP, allowing users to configure bypass conditions and monitor device status.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware/Software Solutions:</strong> Available in both hardware-based and software-based solutions depending on the use case and network environment.</li>

            <h3>Types of Bypass Switches</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inline Bypass Switches:</strong> These switches are placed directly in-line with network devices to automatically redirect traffic if the primary device fails.</li>
                <li><strong>Out-of-Band Bypass Switches:</strong> These switches operate in a redundant manner, where a backup network path is used when the primary device fails.</li>
                <li><strong>Bypass TAPs (Test Access Points):</strong> These devices allow network traffic monitoring and also enable bypass capabilities for continuous network operations.</li>
