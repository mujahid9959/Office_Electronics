    <h1>HVAC Surge Protectors</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>HVAC Surge Protectors are designed to safeguard heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems from electrical surges caused by lightning, power outages, or other electrical disturbances. These protectors are essential for protecting expensive HVAC equipment such as air conditioners, heaters, heat pumps, and refrigeration systems from damage that can be caused by sudden spikes in voltage. HVAC surge protectors typically work by diverting excess voltage away from the system, ensuring the equipment remains safe while maintaining normal operation.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $50 - $200</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
