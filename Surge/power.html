    <h1>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with Surge Protection</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with surge protection is a crucial component for safeguarding electronic devices from power interruptions, surges, and spikes. It provides backup power during blackouts and helps protect your devices from electrical damage caused by fluctuations in the power supply. UPS systems are commonly used in homes, offices, data centers, and industrial environments to ensure that critical equipment such as computers, servers, networking gear, and medical devices stay powered and secure during power disturbances. With surge protection built-in, these systems offer an added layer of security to prevent electrical surges from damaging sensitive electronics.</p>

        <h2 class="price">Price Range: $50 - $2,000+</h2>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div class="features">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Battery Backup:</strong> UPS systems provide temporary backup power during power outages, allowing you to safely shut down your devices or continue operating for a short period.</li>
                <li><strong>Surge Protection:</strong> These systems protect connected devices from electrical surges or spikes that can cause significant damage, especially to sensitive electronics like computers and servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Outlets:</strong> UPS devices typically include multiple outlets, allowing you to plug in several devices simultaneously while providing protection from both power interruptions and surges.</li>
                <li><strong>LCD Display (in some models):</strong> Some UPS models come with an LCD display that shows important information such as battery status, load level, and input/output voltage, providing real-time monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR):</strong> Many UPS systems include AVR technology, which adjusts the voltage level to protect connected devices from under-voltage and over-voltage conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Start Capability:</strong> Some models allow devices to start up even when there is no input power available, providing extra flexibility in critical situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy-Efficient Design:</strong> Many modern UPS systems are designed to be energy-efficient, reducing power consumption during normal operation and providing environmentally friendly solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>USB Connectivity:</strong> Some UPS systems come with USB ports for easy monitoring and remote management through connected software, especially for higher-end models.</li>
                <li><strong>Overload and Short-Circuit Protection:</strong> Built-in overload protection helps prevent damage to the UPS unit and connected devices by automatically disconnecting in the event of an overload or short circuit.</li>
            </ul>
