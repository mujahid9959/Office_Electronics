        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Dynamic Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Dynamic microphones are a popular type of microphone used in various applications, ranging from live performances to studio recordings. They are known for their durability, affordability, and ability to handle high sound pressure levels. Dynamic mics work through a moving coil and magnet mechanism, making them ideal for capturing loud sounds without distortion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Dynamic microphones are built to last, with rugged construction that can withstand high volumes and rough handling.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Generally more budget-friendly compared to condenser microphones, making them a great choice for those just starting or on a budget.</li>
                <li><strong>Versatile Usage:</strong> Suitable for a wide range of applications, including live performances, podcasts, broadcasting, and studio recording.</li>
                <li><strong>High Sound Pressure Handling:</strong> Dynamic mics can handle high sound pressure levels without distortion, making them ideal for loud sound sources like guitar amplifiers or drum kits.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Sensitivity to Background Noise:</strong> Dynamic microphones typically have a cardioid or supercardioid pickup pattern, which isolates sound from the front and rejects noise from the sides and rear.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Because of their simple construction, dynamic microphones require little maintenance and are less susceptible to damage from moisture or temperature changes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polar Pattern:</strong> Cardioid (most common), Supercardioid, or Omnidirectional.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Response:</strong> Typically between 50 Hz and 15 kHz, though some models may offer wider ranges.</li>
                <li><strong>Impedance:</strong> Generally between 150 and 600 ohms, making them compatible with most audio equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Type:</strong> XLR (balanced), often requiring a microphone preamp or audio interface for proper signal transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Requirements:</strong> Dynamic microphones do not require external power or batteries, unlike condenser microphones.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Ideal for live sound reinforcement, vocal performance, guitar amps, drums, podcasts, and broadcasting.</li>
            </ul>
