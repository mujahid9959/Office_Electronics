            <h3>What Are Lavalier (Lapel) Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Lavalier microphones, also known as lapel mics, are small clip-on microphones typically worn on the user's clothing, close to the mouth. These microphones are widely used in television, film, public speaking, and presentations due to their discreet design and hands-free functionality. They offer high-quality audio capture while remaining unobtrusive, making them perfect for scenarios where the microphone needs to be hidden or when the user needs to move freely.</p>
