        <div class="section">
            <h3>What Are Parabolic Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Parabolic microphones use a parabolic reflector (a dish-shaped object) to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone at the focal point. This design allows the microphone to capture distant sounds clearly, making them ideal for surveillance, wildlife observation, sports events, and broadcasting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Directional Sound Capture:</strong> The parabolic dish focuses sound in one direction, making it highly effective for picking up distant sounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Range:</strong> Parabolic microphones can capture sounds from hundreds of feet away with clear quality, making them perfect for outdoor environments.</li>
                <li><strong>High Sensitivity:</strong> These microphones are highly sensitive and can capture sounds at a distance that regular microphones can't.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact and Portable:</strong> Many parabolic microphones are designed to be lightweight and easy to transport, making them convenient for fieldwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Widely Used:</strong> Parabolic microphones are often used for wildlife recording, sports events, security surveillance, and scientific research.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
