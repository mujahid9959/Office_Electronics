            <h3>What Are Ribbon Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Ribbon microphones are a type of dynamic microphone that use a thin metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field to capture sound. Known for their vintage sound and smooth, natural tone, ribbon mics excel in studio settings, especially for capturing vocals, string instruments, and certain brass instruments. Due to their delicate nature, they are less commonly used in live sound applications but are highly regarded in high-end recording studios.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Sound Quality:</strong> Ribbon microphones provide a smooth, natural, and vintage sound with less harshness than other microphone types.</li>
                <li><strong>Delicate Design:</strong> Ribbon mics are delicate and fragile. They should be handled with care, as they can be damaged by excessive air pressure (e.g., from loud sounds or high SPLs).</li>
                <li><strong>Bidirectional (Figure-8) Polar Pattern:</strong> Most ribbon microphones have a bidirectional polar pattern, capturing sound from the front and rear while rejecting sounds from the sides. This makes them ideal for capturing room ambience or for specific recording applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Self-Noise:</strong> Ribbon microphones tend to have low self-noise, making them suitable for capturing subtle details in quiet environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Vintage Character:</strong> Known for their vintage warmth and smoothness, they are often chosen for their tonal characteristics, especially in high-end recordings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency Response:</strong> Typically between 20 Hz and 18 kHz, though some models may extend beyond this range.</li>
                <li><strong>Impedance:</strong> Low impedance (usually between 150 and 250 ohms), requiring a microphone preamp with proper gain to function optimally.</li>
                <li><strong>Polar Pattern:</strong> Most ribbon mics feature a bidirectional or figure-8 polar pattern, though some may be unidirectional with specific designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Requirements:</strong> Ribbon microphones do not require phantom power but can benefit from a preamp with high gain due to their relatively low output.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Primarily used in studio settings for capturing vocals, brass, strings, and certain percussion instruments, as well as for capturing room ambiance.</li>
            </ul>
