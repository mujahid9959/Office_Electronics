            <h3>What Are Condenser Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Condenser microphones are known for their superior sound quality, high sensitivity, and wide frequency response. They work on an electrostatic principle using a diaphragm and a charged backplate. These microphones require an external power source, often provided by phantom power from a mixer or audio interface. Condenser mics are ideal for capturing delicate sounds like vocals, acoustic instruments, and studio recordings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Sensitivity:</strong> Condenser microphones are incredibly sensitive and can capture detailed and nuanced sound, making them perfect for studio use.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Frequency Response:</strong> These mics have a broad frequency range, allowing them to pick up high and low frequencies with clarity.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate Sound Capture:</strong> They excel in recording vocals, string instruments, and other acoustic sources where capturing the detail of the sound is important.</li>
                <li><strong>Requires External Power:</strong> Condenser microphones need phantom power (48V) or an internal battery to operate, unlike dynamic microphones that donâ€™t need power.</li>
                <li><strong>Delicate Construction:</strong> They are more fragile than dynamic microphones and should be handled with care, especially in live sound environments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polar Pattern:</strong> Common patterns include cardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional, and supercardioid.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Response:</strong> Typically between 20 Hz to 20 kHz, some models go beyond this range.</li>
                <li><strong>Impedance:</strong> Low impedance (usually between 100 and 200 ohms), making them compatible with professional audio equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Requirements:</strong> Condenser microphones require phantom power (usually 48V) or an internal battery, which is often supplied by a mixer or audio interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Ideal for studio recording, podcasting, vocal performance, acoustic instruments, and film production.</li>
            </ul>
