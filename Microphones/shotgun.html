            <h3>What Are Shotgun Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Shotgun microphones are highly directional microphones designed to capture sound from a specific area while rejecting unwanted noise from the sides and rear. They have a narrow pickup pattern, making them ideal for capturing audio from a distance. Shotgun mics are commonly used in film and television production, theater, sports events, and field recording, where clear audio capture from a distance is necessary.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly Directional Pickup:</strong> Designed to capture sound from a specific direction with minimal interference from the surroundings.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrow Pickup Pattern:</strong> Typically offers supercardioid or hypercardioid patterns for precise sound capture.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer Distance Audio Capture:</strong> Perfect for capturing distant sounds or voices while minimizing background noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Wind Protection:</strong> Often comes with accessories like windshields to protect the microphone from wind noise during outdoor use.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Ideal for film sets, live theater, sports broadcasting, and nature recording where isolation of the sound source is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
