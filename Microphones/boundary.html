            <h3>What Are Boundary Microphones?</h3>
            <p>Boundary microphones, also known as PZM (Pressure Zone Microphones), are designed to pick up sound from a large area, typically used in conference rooms, auditoriums, or any setting that requires high-quality audio capture from a wider range of sources. These mics work by placing the microphone on a flat surface like a table or floor, using the surface to reflect sound and improve capture quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wide Pickup Pattern:</strong> Boundary microphones capture sound from all directions in a wide area, making them ideal for group discussions, meetings, or conferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface Placement:</strong> They are typically placed on a flat surface, such as a conference table, to use the surface as a reflective sound source for enhanced audio capture.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Audio:</strong> These microphones are designed to provide high-quality audio, even in large or noisy environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Discreet Design:</strong> Many boundary mics are small and unobtrusive, designed to blend into the environment for aesthetic purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Application:</strong> Ideal for video conferencing, teleconferencing, and public speaking, often used in boardrooms, classrooms, and lecture halls.</li>
            </ul>
